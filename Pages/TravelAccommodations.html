		<h2>Saint Paul, MN</h2>

		 /> 
		<p>The wedding weekend will be taking place in Sararosa's home state of Minnesota, 		specifically the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Airlines that serve the MSP airport from the West Coast include Delta, Alaska, and Sun Country — among many others. For those traveling from elsewhere, MSP is a Delta hub and there are plenty of other airlines that connect it to other areas of the country.</p>
		<p>Minnesota is infamous for its harsh winters, but the warmer seasons can be quite temperate. Expect humidity caused by the 10,000 lakes. Late summer temperates have an average high of 86, with a low of 62. Sudden downpours and thunderstorms are common.</p>
