		<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
		 
		<h3>What is the dress code?</h3>
		<p>The dress code is semi-formal. For men, this means a suit jacket or blazer with dressy pants. For women, knee to mid length dresses, fancy jumpsuits or even more tailored looks work if that is your thing! Feel free to be festive, playful and fun with your outfit.</p>
		
		<h3>Will there be GF, DF, NF, or any other foods free from my allergens/food intolerances? Are there vegan and vegetarian options?</h3>
		<p>Yes! One of the reasons we chose the caterer/venue we did was because of the options they offered for people with allergies and/or intolerances. We will be doing a plated dinner, so things should be a bit easier for those with specific dietary needs than a buffet would be. Please let us know when you RSVP if the meal options do not work for your intolerances or allergies, and we can work with the caterer to come up with something.</p>
		
		<h3>Is the venue accessible?</h3>
		<p>The indoor venue space features a set of stairs up to the reception area. There is an elevator right next to the stairs. The ceremony is planned to be outdoors on a grassy area right next to the building. We will reserve seating closer to the back of this area for guests who may have issues walking on grass. It also has air-conditioning.</p>
		
		<h3>Are children welcome to attend?</h3>
		<p>Yes! We're exploring options to make the wedding as child-friendly as possible, including specific kids' meals and small activities. Bartenders will be vigilant about patrons less than four feet in height.</p>
		
		<h3>How do I get to the venue from my accommodation?</h3>
		<p>One of the perks of this venue is that it is right near many hotels in downtown Saint Paul. All of the hotels that we have room blocks for are roughly within a half mile  of the venue, so it is walkable if you are able. In addition, there is paid city parking right across the street from the venue and a small lot for the wedding party and guests who need handicap parking. If you are staying further out, we recommend driving, ride share or public transit.</p>
		
		<h3>What will the weather be like?</h3>
		<p>Minnesota can get hot and humid in the summer. The average high on this date in August is 86 degrees, but it can get hotter than that. The average low is around 68 degrees.</p>
		
		<h3>If I know for sure whether or not I can attend now, can I RSVP early?</h3>
		<p>Feel free to let SR or Matt know that you can attend early, but please still RSVP formally after receiving your invitation as this allows us to let the caterer know what you would like to eat.</p>
		
		<h3>Can I bring a plus-one?</h3>
		<p>Due to space constraints, we can only accommodate named guests on the invitation. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
