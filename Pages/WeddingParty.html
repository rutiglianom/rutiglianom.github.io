		<h1>Wedding Party</h1>
		 
		<h3>Officiants: </h3>
		<h3>Anna Mallea</h3>
		<img src="../Images/Anna.png" Alt="Our friend Anna"/>
		<p>Anna is one of Sararosa’s best friends from college and one of her first friends to meet Matt. Anna and Sararosa met in journalism school and both now work in mental health. Anna brings a mix of the soon-to-be weds backgrounds to this ceremony as she herself is Jewish and Italian. Anna enjoys crushing Sararosa and Matt at Mario Kart 64 and hosting a creatively themed get-together for her friends.</p>

		<h3>Tess Novotny</h3>
		<img src="../Images/Tess.heic" Alt="Our friend Tess"/>
		<p>Tess is one of Sararosa’s friends from journalism school and one of the coolest people you’ll ever meet. She happened to be on the phone with Sararosa the moment Sararosa opened up her Hinge app and saw Matt’s “like.” (She told Sararosa to go for it because of Matt’s name). Tess is a wonderful podcast producer and a Taylor Swift fan in the same way Sararosa is. She brings a knack for storytelling and a creative touch to this ceremony. She and her partner (also named Matt) live in Brooklyn, New York, with their cat Endo.</p>
		
		<h3>Maid of Honor: Isabelle Jones</h3>
		<img src="../Images/Isabelle.png" alt="SR's cousin Isabelle"/>
		<p>Isabelle is Sararosa's cousin and maid of honor — born a whopping 8 months after Sararosa. As children, the two cousins liked to dance, “play restaurant” and occasionally bicker. Isabelle and Sararosa attended high school together and lived in separate areas of the country for several years. Now reunited on the West Coast, Sararosa and Isabelle enjoy Zwifting together on their bike trainers, chatting on the phone and reminiscing on their childhood spent doing cartwheels. Isabelle is a materials engineer, rock climber, runner, and hiker. If you see her, ask her about her latest outdoor adventures.</h\p>
		
		<h3>Best Man: Jeremy Rutigliano</h3>
		<img src="../Images/Jeremy.jpg" alt="Matt's brother"/>
		<p>Jeremy is Matthew's older brother. The two have maintained a close relationship their whole lives, and enjoy such brotherly activities as playing video games and watching basketball. Much like Charlie Brown attempting to kick Lucy's football, Matthew is always eager to face his brother at Mario soccer, and his win record makes the New York Jets look downright admirable. Jeremy works as an accountant in Los Angeles, and in his free time, he enjoys volunteering, playing pickup basketball, and being truly evil in board games.</p>
		
		<h3>Additional reading by: Molly Schochet</h3>
		<img src="../Images/Molly.jpg" alt="SR's cousin Molly"/>
		<p>Molly is another cousin of Sararosa and will be reading a special passage during the ceremony. Molly once asked Matt if the Orman family was loud enough for him at a gathering. (She has wonderful comedic timing.) When in the same state, Molly and Sararosa enjoy chatting, baking and sewing/crafting. When she visited Sararosa and Matt after their engagement, she used her skills as a consumate baker to make a huge spread of gluten free cookies. She is a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin and works in child life.</p>
		
		<h3>Flower Girls: Stevie and Emmalyn</h3>
		<p>Emmalyn is a flower girl and Sararosa's cousin Susan's daughter. She enjoys dancing and hails from the Wisconsin contingent of Sararosa's family. Go Pack Go!</p>

		<p>Stevie is a flower girl and Sararosa’s cousin Sophia’s daughter. She is fun- loving and sassy.</p>
		
		<h3>Dog of Honor: Wheeler Davies Rutigliano</h3>
		<img src="../Images/DogOfHonor.jpg" alt="The Dog of Honor" /> 
		<p>Wheeler is Sararosa and Matt's dog. He will be getting ready for the day with his two favorite people and joining the couple for a few photos. If you see him this weekend, give him a pet and some love.</p>
		
		<h3>Luigi</h3>
