		<h1>Things to do</h1>
		 
		<p>There’s a lot of wonderful art, nature, food and other sights to be enjoyed in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area. The wedding will specifically be taking place in Downtown Saint Paul, which has some great access to museums and other culture. Here are a few of our recommendations in the Twin Cities area. The further down the list an entry is, the farther it is from the wedding area.</p>
		
		<h3>See the Peanuts statues in downtown Saint Paul</h3>
		<p>Peanuts creator Charles M. Schultz was a native of Saint Paul, spending much of his life in the Twin Cities area. After Schultz' death in 2000, several artists were commissioned to create "life-size" bronze statues of his most beloved characters, which were gradually completed and installed in Landmark Plaza. This is only a short walk away from the hotels we recommend staying at.</p>
		
		<h3>Visit Candyland in downtown Saint Paul</h3>
		<p>You know those big candy stores at touristy coastal towns? There's a great one right downtown. People go nuts for the "Chicago mix" caramel corn, which is practically identical to the "Oregon style" popcorn at Portland's classic Joe Brown's carmel corn. Hmm...</p>
		
		<h3>Walk the skyways in downtown Minneapolis or Saint Paul</h3>
		<p class="center">They’re cool.</p>

		<h3>Visit a Museum</h3>
		<p>For modern art buffs and those who like pretty views, the Walker Art Museum and 
		Sculpture Garden is a good spot to visit. Make sure to get a photo in front of the Cherry and the Spoon statue! The Weisman Art Museum on the University of Minnesota campus is also worth a visit. For all of the born and bred Oregonians out there, the Minnesota Science Museum is up there with OMSI as a great science museum. Catch an educational movie in the Omnitheater or take a gander at all the fossils in the Collector’s Corner — one of Sararosa’s favorite parts of the museum growing up. Last time we went, Matt enjoyed the giant floating astronaut. Other museums worth a visit include the Bakken Museum in Minneapolis, which is dedicated to electromagnetic engineering. It is worth noting the Bakken Museum and Science Museum are both good for kids and families; that being said, the beloved Frankenstein show at the Bakken has a great jump scare for those with sensitive kids. Matt found the jump scare somewhat startling, but Sararosa screaming in his ear was the real shock.</p>
		
		<h3>View Minnehaha Falls, bike along River Road, paddleboard on Lake Bde Maka Ska or walk around Lake Harriet</h3>
		<p>It isn’t a trip to Minnesota without viewing some amount of water — whether in lake or big river form. Minnehaha Falls is a beautiful waterfall nestled in a park IN THE CITY of Minneapolis (take that, Portland!). From there, you can hop on a bike or walk and see the Mississippi from the River Road pedestrian/bike path. If you’d like to enjoy some water sports, rent a paddle board if the weather is nice and do some stand up paddle boarding on Bde Maka Ska or Lake of the Isles. Sararosa particularly enjoyed walking around the Linden Hills neighborhood near Lake Harriet as a kid. After walking near Lake Harriet, stop at Sebastian Joes for some Nicollet Pothole ice cream.</p>
		
		<h3>See Paisley Park, visit a record store and see the stars at First Avenue</h3>
		<p>In the suburb of Chanhassen, there’s a place where you can party like it’s 1999 (Matt’s birth year!). Paisley Park is Prince’s former estate, now a museum. Book a tour to learn more about Prince’s music and life or see if there’s an event to attend there. There are plenty of cool record stores in the Twin Cities — Electric Fetus is a great place for records, CDs, and souvenirs in Minneapolis. Agharta Records in Saint Paul is also a cool spot to visit. Another place for the music buffs out there is the famed First Avenue, consistently rated as one of the best independent music venues in the country. Prince filmed parts of Purple Rain there. You might recognize one of your favorite artists on the white stars painted on the walls — yes, those are all artists that have played there!<p>
		
		<h3>Visit the Minnesota State Fair - August 27 to Labor Day, September 7</h3>
		<p>The MN State Fair is one of the best and biggest in the country. It is known for its many food options, buckets of cookies, and a booth where for a few dollars you can have almost unlimited milk. If you are here for long enough to go to the fair, please enjoy some of that nearly unlimited chocolate milk in honor of Sararosa and Matt. (Unlimited lactaid is unfortunately not provided.)</p>
		
		<h3>Attend professional sports game</h3>
		<p>Of course, schedules haven't come out yet, but August will be midseason for the Minnesota Twins (MLB), Minnesota Lynx (WNBA), Minnesota United FC (MLS), and preseason for the Minnesota Vikings (NFL). For what it's worth, as of my writing this, the Lynx are the most exciting team on this list, having made it to the WNBA finals in the 2023-24 season.</p>
		
		<h3>Visit the Mecca of our capitalist hellscape</h3>
		<p>I don't have to say what it is. You know what I'm talking about. It's there. It's got a SpongeBob roller coaster.</p>
