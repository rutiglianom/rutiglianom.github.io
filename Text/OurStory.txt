It all started with Joni Mitchell and Joan Didion. Sararosa and Matt, like many couples today, first met on the dating app Hinge. Matt messaged Sararosa with a long paragraph comparing Joni Mitchell and Joan Didion's perspectives on the state of California after viewing a comment on Sararosa's profile about the two women. Sararosa liked his analysis and thought he was cute, so the two planned on going to Rose City Book Pub in a few days. These original first date plans were dashed when Sararosa caught COVID, so the two of them (and a shaggy Wheeler) went on a masked walk when she recovered.

At the end of their third date, Wheeler had a seizure and Matt drove the three of them to DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital, where they spent a night worrying about the little guy and falling for each other. From then on, SR and Matt were inseparable â€” going on bike rides, watching Curb Your Enthusiasm and enjoying their shared love of reading, music and food.

Matt, the practical and creative software engineer, proposed to Sararosa, a newly minted social work grad student, at the couple's favorite fancy restaurant in Portland in June 2025. He slid the ring across the table, and they both cried.

They are excited to embark on this new stage of their relationship, and Wheeler is excited for his parents to finally make it legal. They are looking forward to celebrating their wedding with people from across their community.
